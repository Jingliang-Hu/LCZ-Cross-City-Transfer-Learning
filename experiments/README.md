# Experiments
## Parameter setting
In each script, parameters are saved in "paraDict".
## Re-run
Example with upper boundary.
```bash
cd 0_upper_boundary
python baseline_upper_bound.py
```
## Output
Each run will create a folder whose name has main parameters and a time stamp. Values of "paraDict" would also be saved in the folder.

# Description
This folder contains all implemented algorithms in the paper.
